For connection types where interface names cannot easily be made persistent (e.g. mobile broadband or USB Ethernet), this property should not be used. Setting this property restricts the interfaces a connection can be used with, and if interface names change or are reordered the connection may be applied to the wrong interface." />

The stable-id is used for generating IPv6 stable private addresses with ipv6.addr-gen-mode=stable-privacy. It is also used to seed the generated cloned MAC address for ethernet.cloned-mac-address=stable and wifi.cloned-mac-address=stable. Note that also the interface name of the activating connection and a per-host secret key is included into the address generation so that the same stable-id on different hosts/devices yields different addresses. If the value is unset, an ID unique for the connection is used. Specifying a stable-id allows multiple connections to generate the same addresses. Another use is to generate IDs at runtime via dynamic substitutions. The '$' character is treated special to perform dynamic substitutions at runtime. Currently supported are &quot;${CONNECTION}&quot;, &quot;${BOOT}&quot;, &quot;${RANDOM}&quot;. These effectively create unique IDs per-connection, per-boot, or every time. Any unrecognized patterns following '$' are treated verbatim, however are reserved for future use. You are thus advised to avoid '$' or escape it as &quot;$$&quot;. For example, set it to &quot;${CONNECTION}/${BOOT}&quot; to create a unique id for this connection that changes with every reboot. Note that two connections only use the same effective id if their stable-id is also identical before performing dynamic substitutions." />

It should be assigned when the connection is created, and never changed as long as the connection still applies to the same network.  For example, it should not be changed when the &quot;id&quot; property or NMSettingIP4Config changes, but might need to be re-created when the Wi-Fi SSID, mobile broadband network provider, or &quot;type&quot; property changes. The UUID must be in the format &quot;2815492f-7e56-435e-b2e9-246bd7cdc664&quot; (ie, contains only hexadecimal characters and &quot;-&quot;)." />

If the property is set to EUI64, the addresses will be generated using the interface tokens derived from hardware address. This makes the host part of the address to stay constant, making it possible to track host's presence when it changes networks. The address changes when the interface hardware is replaced. The value of stable-privacy enables use of cryptographically secure hash of a secret host-specific key along with the connection's stable-id and the network address as specified by RFC7217. This makes it impossible to use the address track host's presence, and makes the address stable when the network interface hardware is replaced. On D-Bus, the absence of an addr-gen-mode setting equals enabling stable-privacy. For keyfile plugin, the absence of the setting on disk means EUI64 so that the property doesn't change on upgrade from older versions.

Note that when using dns=dnsmasq the order is meaningless since dnsmasq forwards queries to all known servers at the same time.

For libnm and nmcli, this field is called &quot;cloned-mac-address&quot;." />
    <property name="generate-mac-address-mask" name_upper="GENERATE_MAC_ADDRESS_MASK" type="string" description="With &quot;cloned-mac-address&quot; setting &quot;random&quot; or &quot;stable&quot;, by default all bits of the MAC address are scrambled and a locally-administered, unicast MAC address is created. This property allows to specify that certain bits are fixed. Note that the least significant bit of the first MAC address will always be unset to create a unicast MAC address. If the property is NULL, it is eligible to be overwritten by a default connection setting. If the value is still NULL or an empty string, the default is to create a locally-administered, unicast MAC address. If the value contains one MAC address, this address is used as mask. The set bits of the mask are to be filled with the current MAC address of the device, while the unset bits are subject to randomization. Setting &quot;FE:FF:FF:00:00:00&quot; means to preserve the OUI of the current MAC address and only randomize the lower 3 bytes using the &quot;random&quot; or &quot;stable&quot; algorithm. If the value contains one additional MAC address after the mask, this address is used instead of the current MAC address to fill the bits that shall not be randomized. For example, a value of &quot;FE:FF:FF:00:00:00 68:F7:28:00:00:00&quot; will set the OUI of the MAC address to 68:F7:28, while the lower bits are randomized. A value of &quot;02:00:00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00:00:00&quot; will create a fully scrambled globally-administered, burned-in MAC address. If the value contains more than one additional MAC addresses, one of them is chosen randomly. For example, &quot;02:00:00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00:00:00 02:00:00:00:00:00&quot; will create a fully scrambled MAC address, randomly locally or globally administered." />
