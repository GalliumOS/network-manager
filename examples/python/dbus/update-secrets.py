# The example shows how to update secrets in a connection by means of D-Bus
# Update() method. The method replaces all previous settings with new ones
# including possible secrets.
# So, we get all settings using GetSettings() and then find out what secrets
# are associated with the connection using GetSecrets(), ask for new secret 
# values, and add them to the settings that we pass to Update().
