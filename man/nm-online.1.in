.TH NM-ONLINE "1" "25 March 2014"

.SH NAME
nm-online \- ask NetworkManager whether the network is connected
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nm-online
.RI " [ " OPTIONS " ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nm-online
is a utility to find out whether we are online. It is done by asking
NetworkManager about its status. When run, \fInm\-online\fP waits until
NetworkManager reports an active connection, or specified timeout expires. On
exit, the returned status code should be checked (see the return codes bellow).
.P
By default NetworkManager waits for IPv4 dynamic addressing to complete but does
not wait for the "auto" IPv6 dynamic addressing.  To wait for IPv6 addressing to
complete, either (1) change the network connection's IPv6 "may-fail" setting to "no",
and/or (2) change the IPv6 addressing method to "manual" or "dhcp", to indicate that
IPv6 connectivity is expected.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-timeout <timeout_value>
Time to wait for a connection, in seconds.  If the option is not provided,
the default timeout is 30 seconds.
.TP
.B \-x, \-\-exit
Exit immediately if NetworkManager is not running or connecting.
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Don't print anything.
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-wait-for-startup
Wait for NetworkManager startup to complete, rather than waiting for
network connectivity specifically. Startup is considered complete once
NetworkManager has activated (or attempted to activate) every
auto-activate connection which is available given the current network
state. (This is generally only useful at boot time; after startup has
completed, \fInm-online -s\fP will just return immediately, regardless
of the current network state.)

.SH EXIT STATUS

.IP "0" 4
Success - already online or connection established within given timeout
.IP "1" 4
Offline or not online within given timeout
.IP "2" 4
Unspecified error
