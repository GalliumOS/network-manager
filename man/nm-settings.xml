          NetworkManager is based on a concept of connection profiles, sometimes referred to as
          connections only. These connection profiles contain a network configuration. When
          NetworkManager activates a connection profile on a network device the configuration will
          be applied and an active network connection will be established. Users are free to create
          as many connection profiles as they see fit. Thus they are flexible in having various network
          configurations for different networking needs. The connection profiles are handled by
          NetworkManager via <emphasis>settings service</emphasis> and are exported on D-Bus
          (<emphasis>/org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/Settings/&lt;num&gt;</emphasis> objects).
          The conceptual objects can be described as follows:
          <variablelist><varlistentry><term>Connection (profile)</term><listitem><para>
                  A specific, encapsulated, independent group of settings describing
                  all the configuration required to connect to a specific network.
                  It is referred to by a unique identifier called the UUID. A connection
                  is tied to a one specific device type, but not necessarily a specific
                  hardware device. It is composed of one or more <emphasis>Settings</emphasis>
                  objects.
                </para></listitem></varlistentry></variablelist><variablelist><varlistentry><term>Setting</term><listitem><para>
                  A group of related key/value pairs describing a specific piece of a
                  <emphasis>Connection (profile)</emphasis>. Settings keys and allowed values are
                  described in the tables below. Keys are also referred to as properties.
                  Developers can find the setting objects and their properties in the libnm-util
                  sources. Look for the <function>class_init</function> functions near the bottom of
                  each setting source file.
                </para></listitem></varlistentry></variablelist><variablelist><para>
              The settings and properties shown in tables below list all available connection
              configuration options. However, note that not all settings are applicable to all
              connection types. NetworkManager provides a command-line tool <emphasis>nmcli</emphasis>
              that allows direct configuration of the settings and properties according to a connection
              profile type. <emphasis>nmcli</emphasis> connection editor has also a built-in
              <emphasis>describe</emphasis> command that can display description of particular settings
              and properties of this page.

The permitted values are: "eui64", or "stable-privacy". If the property is set to "eui64", the addresses will be generated using the interface tokens derived from  hardware address. This makes the host part of the address to stay constant, making it possible to track host's presence when it changes networks. The address changes when the interface hardware is replaced. The value of "stable-privacy" enables use of cryptographically secure hash of a secret host-specific key along with the connection identification and the network address as specified by RFC7217. This makes it impossible to use the address track host's presence, and makes the address stable when the network interface hardware is replaced. On D-Bus, the absence of an addr-gen-mode setting equals enabling "stable-privacy". For keyfile plugin, the absence of the setting on disk means "eui64" so that the property doesn't change on upgrade from older versions.

            Each secret property in a setting has an associated <emphasis>flags</emphasis> property
            that describes how to handle that secret. The <emphasis>flags</emphasis> property is a bitfield
            that contains zero or more of the following values logically OR-ed together.
          </para><itemizedlist><listitem><para>0x0 (none) - the system is responsible for providing and storing this secret.</para></listitem><listitem><para>0x1 (agent-owned) - a user-session secret agent is responsible for providing and storing
              this secret; when it is required, agents will be asked to provide it.</para></listitem><listitem><para>0x2 (not-saved) - this secret should not be saved but should be requested from the user
              each time it is required. This flag should be used for One-Time-Pad secrets, PIN codes from hardware tokens,
              or if the user simply does not want to save the secret.</para></listitem><listitem><para>0x4 (not-required) - in some situations it cannot be automatically determined that a secret
              is required or not. This flag hints that the secret is not required and should not be requested from the user.</para></listitem></itemizedlist></refsect2></refsect1><refsect1 id="files"><title>Files</title><para><filename>/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections</filename> or distro plugin-specific location</para></refsect1><refsect1 id="see_also"><title>See Also</title><para><citerefentry><refentrytitle>NetworkManager</refentrytitle><manvolnum>8</manvolnum></citerefentry>,
