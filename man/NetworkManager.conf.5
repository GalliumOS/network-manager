.SH "NAME"
NetworkManager.conf \- NetworkManager configuration file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager\&.conf,
/etc/NetworkManager/conf\&.d/\fIname\fR\&.conf
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This is a configuration file for NetworkManager\&. It is used to set up various aspects of NetworkManager\*(Aqs behavior\&. The location of the file may be changed through use of the
\fB\-\-config\fR
argument for NetworkManager\&.
.PP
If a default
NetworkManager\&.conf
is provided by your distribution\*(Aqs packages, you should not modify it, since your changes may get overwritten by package updates\&. Instead, you can add additional
\&.conf
files to the
conf\&.d
directory\&. These will be read in order, with later files overriding earlier ones\&.
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
The configuration file format is so\-called key file (sort of ini\-style format)\&. It consists of sections (groups) of key\-value pairs\&. Lines beginning with a \*(Aq#\*(Aq and blank lines are considered comments\&. Sections are started by a header line containing the section enclosed in \*(Aq[\*(Aq and \*(Aq]\*(Aq, and ended implicitly by the start of the next section or the end of the file\&. Each key\-value pair must be contained in a section\&.
.PP
For keys that take a list of devices as their value, you can specify devices by their MAC addresses or interface names, or "*" to specify all devices\&.
.PP
Minimal system settings configuration file looks like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
	[main]
	plugins=keyfile
      
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
As an extension to the normal keyfile format, you can also append a value to a previously\-set list\-valued key by doing:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
	plugins+=another\-plugin
      
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.SH "MAIN SECTION"
.PP
\fIplugins\fR
.RS 4
Lists system settings plugin names separated by \*(Aq,\*(Aq\&. These plugins are used to read and write system\-wide connections\&. When multiple plugins are specified, the connections are read from all listed plugins\&. When writing connections, the plugins will be asked to save the connection in the order listed here; if the first plugin cannot write out that connection type (or can\*(Aqt write out any connections) the next plugin is tried, etc\&. If none of the plugins can save the connection, an error is returned to the user\&.
.sp
If NetworkManager defines a distro\-specific network\-configuration plugin for your system, then that will normally be listed here\&. (See below for the available plugins\&.) Note that the
keyfile
plugin is always appended to the end of this list (if it doesn\*(Aqt already appear earlier in the list), so if there is no distro\-specific plugin for your system then you can leave this key unset and NetworkManager will default to using
keyfile\&.
.RE
.PP
\fImonitor\-connection\-files\fR
.RS 4
Whether the configured settings plugin(s) should set up file monitors and immediately pick up changes made to connection files while NetworkManager is running\&. This is disabled by default; NetworkManager will only read the connection files at startup, and when explicitly requested via the ReloadConnections D\-Bus call\&. If this key is set to \*(Aqtrue\*(Aq, then NetworkManager will reload connection files any time they changed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIdhcp\fR
.RS 4
This key sets up what DHCP client NetworkManager will use\&. Presently
dhclient
and
dhcpcd
are supported\&. The client configured here should be available on your system too\&. If this key is missing, available DHCP clients are looked for in this order: dhclient, dhcpcd\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIno\-auto\-default\fR
.RS 4
Comma\-separated list of devices for which NetworkManager shouldn\*(Aqt create default wired connection (Auto eth0)\&. By default, NetworkManager creates a temporary wired connection for any Ethernet device that is managed and doesn\*(Aqt have a connection configured\&. List a device in this option to inhibit creating the default connection for the device\&. May have the special value
*
to apply to all devices\&.
.sp
When the default wired connection is deleted or saved to a new persistent connection by a plugin, the device is added to a list in the file
/var/run/NetworkManager/no\-auto\-default\&.state
to prevent creating the default connection for that device again\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
	    no\-auto\-default=00:22:68:5c:5d:c4,00:1e:65:ff:aa:ee
	    no\-auto\-default=eth0,eth1
	    no\-auto\-default=*
	  
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.RE
.PP
\fIignore\-carrier\fR
.RS 4
Comma\-separated list of devices for which NetworkManager will (partially) ignore the carrier state\&. Normally, for device types that support carrier\-detect, such as Ethernet and InfiniBand, NetworkManager will only allow a connection to be activated on the device if carrier is present (ie, a cable is plugged in), and it will deactivate the device if carrier drops for more than a few seconds\&.
.sp
Listing a device here will allow activating connections on that device even when it does not have carrier, provided that the connection uses only statically\-configured IP addresses\&. Additionally, it will allow any active connection (whether static or dynamic) to remain active on the device when carrier is lost\&.
.sp
May have the special value
*
to apply to all devices\&.
.sp
Note that the "carrier" property of NMDevices and device D\-Bus interfaces will still reflect the actual device state; it\*(Aqs just that NetworkManager will not make use of that information\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIdns\fR
.RS 4
Set the DNS (resolv\&.conf) processing mode\&.
.sp
default: The default if the key is not specified\&. NetworkManager will update
resolv\&.conf
to reflect the nameservers provided by currently active connections\&.
.sp
dnsmasq: NetworkManager will run dnsmasq as a local caching nameserver, using a "split DNS" configuration if you are connected to a VPN, and then update
resolv\&.conf
to point to the local nameserver\&.
.sp
unbound: NetworkManager will talk to unbound and dnssec\-triggerd, providing a "split DNS" configuration with DNSSEC support\&. The /etc/resolv\&.conf will be managed by dnssec\-trigger daemon\&.
.sp
none: NetworkManager will not modify resolv\&.conf\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIdebug\fR
.RS 4
Comma separated list of options to aid debugging\&. This value will be combined with the environment variable
NM_DEBUG\&. Currently the following values are supported:
.sp
RLIMIT_CORE: set ulimit \-c unlimited to write out core dumps\&.
.RE
.SH "KEYFILE SECTION"
.PP
This section contains keyfile\-plugin\-specific options, and is normally only used when you are not using any other distro\-specific plugin\&.
.PP
.PP
\fIhostname\fR
.RS 4
Set a persistent hostname\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIunmanaged\-devices\fR
.RS 4
Set devices that should be ignored by NetworkManager when using the
keyfile
plugin\&. Devices are specified in the following format:
.sp
mac:<hwaddr>
or
interface\-name:<ifname>\&. Here
hwaddr
is the MAC address of the device to be ignored, in hex\-digits\-and\-colons notation\&.
ifname
is the interface name of the ignored device\&.
.sp
Multiple entries are separated with semicolons\&. No spaces are allowed in the value\&.
.sp
Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
unmanaged\-devices=interface\-name:em4
unmanaged\-devices=mac:00:22:68:1c:59:b1;mac:00:1E:65:30:D1:C4;interface\-name:eth2
	    
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.RE
.SH "IFUPDOWN SECTION"
.PP
This section contains ifupdown\-specific options and thus only has effect when using the
ifupdown
plugin\&.
.PP
.PP
\fImanaged\fR
.RS 4
If set to
true, then interfaces listed in
/etc/network/interfaces
are managed by NetworkManager\&. If set to
false, then any interface listed in
/etc/network/interfaces
will be ignored by NetworkManager\&. Remember that NetworkManager controls the default route, so because the interface is ignored, NetworkManager may assign the default route to some other interface\&.
.sp
The default value is
false\&.
.RE
.SH "LOGGING SECTION"
.PP
This section controls NetworkManager\*(Aqs logging\&. Any settings here are overridden by the
\fB\-\-log\-level\fR
and
\fB\-\-log\-domains\fR
command\-line options\&.
.PP
.PP
\fIlevel\fR
.RS 4
The default logging verbosity level\&. One of
ERR,
WARN,
INFO,
DEBUG\&. The ERR level logs only critical errors\&. WARN logs warnings that may reflect operation\&. INFO logs various informational messages that are useful for tracking state and operations\&. DEBUG enables verbose logging for debugging purposes\&. Subsequent levels also log all messages from earlier levels; thus setting the log level to INFO also logs error and warning messages\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIdomains\fR
.RS 4
The following log domains are available: PLATFORM, RFKILL, ETHER, WIFI, BT, MB, DHCP4, DHCP6, PPP, WIFI_SCAN, IP4, IP6, AUTOIP4, DNS, VPN, SHARING, SUPPLICANT, AGENTS, SETTINGS, SUSPEND, CORE, DEVICE, OLPC, WIMAX, INFINIBAND, FIREWALL, ADSL, BOND, VLAN, BRIDGE, DBUS_PROPS, TEAM, CONCHECK, DCB, DISPATCH\&.
.sp
In addition, these special domains can be used: NONE, ALL, DEFAULT, DHCP, IP\&.
.sp
You can specify per\-domain log level overrides by adding a colon and a log level to any domain\&. E\&.g\&., "WIFI:DEBUG"\&.

This section controls NetworkManager\*(Aqs optional connectivity checking functionality\&. This allows NetworkManager to detect whether or not the system can actually access the internet or whether it is behind a captive portal\&.
.PP
.PP
\fIuri\fR

\fIkeyfile\fR
.RS 4
The
keyfile
plugin is the generic plugin that supports all the connection types and capabilities that NetworkManager has\&. It writes files out in an \&.ini\-style format in /etc/NetworkManager/system\-connections\&.
.sp
The stored connection file may contain passwords and private keys, so it will be made readable only to root, and the plugin will ignore files that are readable or writeable by any user or group other than root\&.
.sp
This plugin is always active, and will automatically be used to store any connections that aren\*(Aqt supported by any other active plugin\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIifcfg\-rh\fR
.RS 4
This plugin is used on the Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux distributions to read and write configuration from the standard
/etc/sysconfig/network\-scripts/ifcfg\-*

.RE
.PP
\fIifcfg\-suse\fR
.RS 4
This plugin is only provided for simple backward compatibility with SUSE and OpenSUSE configuration\&. Most setups should be using the
