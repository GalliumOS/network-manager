Subject: Don't setup Sleep Monitor if not booted with systemd

NetworkManager uses systemd for suspend/resume support. It listens for
the PrepareForSleep and Resume D-Bus signal sent by logind/systemd and
deactivates the interfaces on sleep and reactivates them on resume.
With a standalone logind we don't get a Resume signal and
NetworkManager remains in sleep mode where the devices are unmanaged.
As a workaround, skip the Sleep Monitor setup if not booted with
systemd.

Closes: #742933
