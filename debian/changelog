    There are currently too many issues with dh_installsystemd, so switch

network-manager (1.9.90-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version 1.9.90
  * Rebase patches
  * Update symbols file for libnm0
  * Disable dhcpcanon and openvswitch support.
    DHCP client support with dhcpcanon is still marked as experimental and
    support for Open vSwitch will require more package related changes. If
    Open vSwitch support is enabled, this will most likely be provided via a
    separate binary package.
  * Register empty NMClient and NetworkManager when loading libnm via GIR.
    This prevents the real modules from being loaded because they would in
    turn load libnm-glib and abort() and crash as loading libnm and
    libnm-glib in the same process is not allowed.
    Patch cherry-picked from upstream Git.

network-manager (1.8.0-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Install ifupdown dispatcher script via network-manager.install.
    This avoids a FTBFS when doing arch:all builds.
    Rename the script to 01-ifupdown while at it for consistencies sake.
    (Closes: #864980)
  * Fix creation of network-manager.service symlink.
    Explicitly specify the network-manager package when creating the
    symlink. Otherwise the symlink is created for the wrong package when
    doing arch:all builds where the first package is not network-manager.
  * Add gir related lintian overrides.
    We deliberately ship NMClient-1.0.typelib alongside
    NetworkManager-1.0.typelib in gir1.2-networkmanager-1.0.
    Add overrides for typelib-package-name-does-not-match and
    gir-missing-typelib-dependency.

    Provide a new package called network-manager-config-connectivity-debian
    which can be installed to enable NetworkManager's connectivity checking
    functionality. This is particularly useful for captive portal detection.
    (Closes: #729783, #859934)
  * Reload NetworkManager after installing
    network-manager-config-connectivity-debian
  * Drop obsolete migration code
  * Stop reloading dbus after installing network-manager.
    Nowadays this is done automatically by dbus via dpkg file triggers.

network-manager (1.8.0-2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * core: fix reading device state file.
    Properly setup devices which were marked as managed=unknown when
    restoring from state file.
  * Split introspection data for libnm into gir1.2-nm-1.0.
    Keep the introspection data for the deprecated libnm-glib and libnm-util
    library in gir1.2-networkmanager-1.0 but split out the introspection data
    for libnm into a new gir1.2-nm-1.0 package.
    This will make a transition from libnm-glib/libnm-util to libnm easier.
    To not break existing packages, add a dependency on gir1.2-nm-1.0 to
    gir1.2-networkmanager-1.0.

  * libnm: disconnect signal from D-Bus proxies on dispose (Closes: #854810)
  * dhcp/dhclient: parse "interface" statements.
    Until now any "interface" statement was ignored and any enclosed
    statement for which we have a special handling was considered, even if
    belonging to a different interface. This can cause wrong options to be
    set in the generated dhclient configuration. (Closes: #855910)

      This fixes a regression introduced by 1.6.0 where  "nm-online -x -q"
      always exits with status 1 (offline). (Closes: #852815)
    - dhcp: dhclient: reset the request list if conf file contains 'request'.
      This fixes DNS resolution problems when using dhclient due to duplicated
      search domain strings in /etc/resolv.conf. (Closes: #854343)

    Cherry-pick a couple of upstream commits which work around driver bugs
    when MAC address randomization is used. (Closes: #835822, #835553)
  * Bump debhelper compat level to 10.
  * Don't try to decrypt PKCS#8 key if no password is supplied. This fixes

network-manager (1.4.0-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Export _IO_stdin_used symbol in NetworkManager.ver.
    This symbol is required to decide which version of certain IO functions
    to use on various architectures. So we can't strip away the symbol from
    the NetworkManager binary as this will lead to segfaults on those

network-manager (1.2.2-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Let NetworkManager.service pull in network.target. This will provide a
    proper ordering on shutdown.
  * Enable NetworkManager-wait-online.service. This ensures that mounting of
    network file systems works properly and SysV init scripts depending on
    $network will be delayed until network is available (or a timeout is
    reached).
  * Make sure NetworkManager-wait-online.service is enabled on upgrades. We
    need to purge the old state, otherwise i-s-h won't enable the service on

network-manager (0.9.4.0-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change the ifupdown dispatcher script and set ADDRFAM to "inet" or "inet6"
    depending on whether the connection has a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.
    Using "NetworkManager" as ADDRFAM type did confuse most ifupdown hook
    scripts and e.g. broke async NFS mounts. (Closes: #475188, #656584)
  * debian/patches/05-force-online-with-unmanaged-devices.patch: If network
    interfaces are configured in /etc/network/interfaces, NM will mark those
    devices as unmanaged by default. If such a network interface has been
    brought up by ifup, set the global online state to CONNECTED.
    (Closes: #512286)
  * No longer run the ifblacklist_migrate.sh script upon installation. This
    script was used to comment out DHCP type network interface configurations
    in /etc/network/interfaces as otherwise NM would mark such devices as
    unmanaged. This script was buggy though and sometimes created a broken
    network configuration.
    Since debian-installer in wheezy (7.0) will create proper configuration
    for NM if the network-manager package is part of the installation, this is
    no longer necessary.
    If users make a minimal system installation and install the
    network-manager package afterwards, show a warning in postinst if we
    find any interface configurations in /etc/network/interfaces.
    (Closes: #688355, #690987, #606268)

  * Move the pkla file to /etc/polkit-1 as requested by the release team.
  * debian/patches/04-systemd-set-kill-mode-process.patch: By default, when
    shutting NM down, systemd will kill everything in its cgroup. But this
    can cause problems (eg, NM thinking that dhclient crashed and then taking
    down an interface that it would otherwise have left up). Fix this by
    setting KillMode=process, which tells systemd to only kill NM itself, and
    let NM kill its children. Patch cherry-picked from upstream Git.

  * debian/patches/17-dbus-remove_max_replies_per_connection_limit.patch:
    Remove 'max_replies_per_connection' limit from D-Bus configuration which
    sets it to 512. It was intended to increase the limit from its historical
    value of 32. However, since 2007 the default limit has been 8192, so this
    is actually a reduction. (Closes: #678965)

    and use the dh_install maintscript facility to move the conffile on
    upgrades. This requires a newer debhelper, so bump the Build-Depends
    accordingly.
