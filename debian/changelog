  * debian/patches/disable_general_with_expect_test.patch: disable
    test_general_with_expect; which is flaky on ppc64el and arm64.
  * debian/tests/nm:
    - Enable mucho logging when running tests, this helps a lot debugging when
      the tests fail.
    - Skip wifi tests for now; they appear to be broken, possibly due to
      changes in wpa 2.4's interaction with mac80211_hwsim.
    - test_manual_ip4 is an expectedFailure. It's not manual at all; and the
      DHCP requests fail to complete.
    - auto_detect_eth is an expectedFailure, both ends of the veth interfaces
      are now unmanaged which causes the tests to fail. These tests will need
      to be rewritten/adapted to the way the world really works.
    - Allow for more than one activeConnection available; this is slightly
      more solid when running tests locally in case other connections come up
      automatically along with the tested ones (bridges, etc.)
    - Check for expected connection UUID in the list of active connections
      UUIDs rather than verifying that the two match exactly.

    - debian/network-manager.install:
      - install ofono plugin and dbus config.
      - install apport hook.
    - debian/NetworkManager.conf:
      - Use the dnsmasq dns plugin by default.
      - Enable the ofono plugin by default.
    - debian/network-manager.dirs: add /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d for custom
      dnsmasq configuration snippets.
    - debian/network-manager.links: create a symlink to the apport hook to be
      reused by nm-applet.
    - debian/network-manager.postinst:
      - Don't need to migrate from sysvinit, just keep removing the sysvinit
        script symlinks.
      - Don't add the netdev group.
    - debian/network-manager.prerm: stop network-manager before removing it.
    - debian/rules:
      - Enable vala, bluez4 support and tests.
      - Explicitly remove the SysV init script from the network-manager package
      - Update translations.
      - Install the tests.
      - Install a dnsmasq configuration to avoid an unconfigured system-wide
        instance to conflict with the local caching from NetworkManager's
        instance of dnsmasq.
      - Run dh_installinit with --no-scripts.
      - Run tests within dbus-test-runner, so that they can successfully run
        in a DBus bus while on minimal build environments.
    - debian/patches:
      - git_ignore_cache_routes_faa7d8ab.patch: don't count RTM_F_CLONED
        routes, they cause NM to spam DBus with useless IPv6 updates.
      - whoopsie-daisy-dbus-support.patch: allow whoopsie access to our bus
        so it can know whether we're online, and whether to send error data.
      - add_sendsigs_omissions.patch: move pidfiles to /run/sendsigs.omit.d
        to avoid upstart killing NM's children too early.
      - quit_dhclient_on_exit.patch: deconfigure network devices when they
        are removed (e.g. on shutdown), so that there is no dhclient process
        left once NetworkManager stops.
      - nm-change-dnsmasq-parameters.diff: Ubuntu-specific option choices for
        the local dnsmasq cache.
      - lp936712_dnsmasq_ip6_ns_ordering.patch: Order IPv6 nameservers before
        IPv4 for dns plugins.
      - dnsmasq-vpn-dns-filtering.patch: take into consideration whether the
        VPN is set for split-tunneling when adding VPN DNS servers.
      - lp990011_use_tempaddr_sysctl_default.patch: take into account the
        Ubuntu-specific path to an extra sysctl config snippet for IPv6
        Privacy extension we ship when reading whether privacy extensions
        should be enabled.
      - adhoc_use_wpa_rsn_part1.patch, adhoc_use_wpa_rsn_part2.patch: re-enable
        Ad-Hoc mode for WPA2; with WPA2 the security settings do tend to work,
        so we can allow users to create such connections.
      - ignore_rmnet_devices.patch: ignore rmnet_usb* devices, they are used by
        RIL/ofono and NM shouldn't try to manage them directly.
      - lp1099983_ignore-p2p-wifi-devices.patch: ignore wireless P2P devices
        shown as p2pN interfaces; we can't support them just now and they cause
        confusion on the system.
      - prioritize_3g_later.patch: re-prioritize 3G and other modem-type
        connections to be less preferred than WiFi and other WiFi-similar
        connections -- they cost money, so the user is more likely to want to
        only use them if nothing else is available, especially on a phone.
      - add_ofono_settings_support.patch: add support for reading oFono's
        configuration files as a basis for connections / APN settings to be
        used by NM.
      - add_ofono_support.patch: add support for using oFono as a modem manager
        in place or alongside ModemManager to connect to mobile data networks.
      - ignore_rfkill_if_urfkill_is_present.patch: support using urfkill as a
        handler for killswitch events rather than relying only on the rfkill
        subsystem.
  * debian/patches/git_assert_test-remote-settings-client_746a13bd.patch,
    debian/patches/git_fix_crash_test-remote-settings-client_98e7145f.patch:
    fix issues in test-remote-settings-client which make the test fail every
    once in a while.
  * debian/control: bump the network-manager Depends for isc-dhcp-client to
    (>= 4.3.1-5ubuntu1), which is the first version with the updated apparmor
    profile that allows our new dhcp helper binary to work.
  * Merged and renamed the dnsmasq DBus updates patches:
    debian/patches/dnsmasq-dbus-updates.patch,
    debian/patches/dns-dnsmasq-interface-and-dbus-path.patch:
    - 0001-dns-use-DBus-to-make-dnsmasq-nameserver-changes.patch: use DBus to
      push updates to dnsmasq rather than restarting it with a modified
      configuration file.
  * Merged and renamed wifi ScanDone patches:
    debian/patches/scan_done_signal.patch,
    debian/patches/remove-extra-scan_done-on-scan-start.patch,
    debian/patches/cull_aps_on_scan_done_signal.patch:
    - 0001-wifi-Signal-on-the-wifi-device-when-its-supplicant-i.patch: send
      a ScanDone signal out on DBus to let applications know a requested scan
      operation has completed.
    - 0002-wifi-cull-the-scan-list-before-signalling-ScanDone-b.patch: cull
      the scan results just before sending the ScanDone signal, so the scan
      results are as up-to-date as possible.
  * debian/patches/monotonic_timestamp_as_boottime.patch: provide a way to
    convert the NM generated monotonic timestamp to a CLOCK_BOOTTIME value, as
    suggested in upstream review of the last_seen patches.
  * Merged and renamed the wifi last_seen timestamp patches:
    debian/patches/ap_publish_last_seen.patch,
    debian/patches/scan_update_last_seen.patch:
    - 0002-wifi-expose-the-last_seen-property-for-a-NMAccessPoi.patch:
      publish last-seen timestamp for wireless accesspoints on DBus.
  * Merged and renamed ofono patches:
    debian/patches/provisioning_wait_ofono_properties.patch,
    debian/patches/track_ip_settings_post_connection.patch,
    debian/patches/dont-check-secrets-for-ofono.patch,
    debian/patches/ofono_mms_support.patch:
    - 0001-wwan-add-support-for-using-oFono-as-a-modem-manager.patch: add
      support for using oFono as a modem manager alongside ModemManager.
  * debian/patches/powersave.patch: replace powersave patch with version from
    upstream branch dcbw/wifi-powersave; based off our inital patch (but with
    lots of improvements). Powersave is now a setting which can be disabled
    per-connection if required:
    - 0001-libnm-libnm-util-add-Wi-Fi-powersave-property.patch
    - 0002-fixup-libnm-libnm-util-add-Wi-Fi-powersave-property.patch
    - 0003-cli-add-support-for-wifi.powersave-setting.patch
    - 0004-wifi-set-wireless-power-save-for-nl80211-devices-whe.patch
    - 0005-fixup-wifi-set-wireless-power-save-for-nl80211-devic.patch
  * debian/patches/git_primary_connection_type_aab7fbfc.patch: add a primary
    connection type property for use by applications to know whether they are
    on mobile data, wifi, or otherwise. Patch by Ryan Lortie; replaces the
    previous patch primary_connection_type.patch with the committed version.
  * debian/patches/default_powersave_on.patch: set wireless dynamic power save
    to enabled by default. It defaults to disabled upstream. Since this is a
    per-connection setting, you can disable powersave for your connections by
    editing the configuration file under /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections
    and adding "powersave=0" under the [802-11-wireless] section.
  * debian/patches/demarshal_int64_properties.patch: properly demarshall
    64-bit integer types in NMObject.
  * debian/patches/only-ignore-host-side-veth.patch: let client-side veth type
    ethernet devices be managed by NetworkManager.
  * debian/control, debian/rules: disable libteam for now, since it's not yet
    suitable for inclusion in main.
  * debian/control: also from libteam-utils from being mentioned in Suggests
    and network-manager binary package description.
  * debian/tests/network_test_base.py, debian/tests/killswitches-no-urfkill,
    debian/tests/nm: update tests for changes in NM behavior and CLI API.

  * Rework the fix for #734460, kill NetworkManager in the postinst script
    instead of the preinst one to minimize downtime on big upgrades

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Don't setup Sleep Monitor if system was not booted with systemd. With a
    standalone logind we don't receive the Resume signal after a suspend
    request and NetworkManager remains in sleep mode where the devices are
    unmanaged. (Closes: #742933)
  * Use dh-autoreconf to update the build system. Override dh_autoreconf since
    we need to run gtkdocize.

  * Bump debhelper compatibility level to 9.
  * Convert to multi-arch. Mark libnm-glib4, libnm-glib-vpn1 and libnm-util2
    as M-A: same. As pppd has not been converted yet, keep installing the ppp
    plugin to /usr/lib/pppd/2.4.5/.
  * Rely on dh v9 to set flags from dpkg-buildflags.
  * Use autotools_dev dh addon for up-to-date config.{guess,sub}.
  * Add Depends on libpam-systemd since NetworkManager requires a properly
    setup logind session. (Closes: #743128)
  * Bump policykit-1 from Recommends to Depends.
  * Move the initial ifstate file check into nm_manager_start () to make sure
    the NMManager object has been fully initialized. (Closes: #730437)

    detection in configure. (LP: #1172062)
  * debian/tests/nm: Verify device type.
  * debian/tests/nm: Don't assert that in IPv4 mode we don't have any IPv6
    configuration. This makes the tests work with current upstream git head.
  * debian/tests/nm: Enlarge DHCP/RA timeout from 8/10 to 15 seconds, this
    still times out too often otherwise.
  * debian/tests/nm: Allow the user to specify extra daemon arguments in
    $NM_TEST_DAEMON_ARGS. With that, one can run NM from upstream git head
    ("--debug --run-from-build-dir") or with extra verbosity
    ("--log-level=DEBUG"). Drop the latter by default, as it makes log files
    harder to read.
  * debian/tests/nm: Avoid comparing current privacy setting against
    NetworkManager.SettingIP6ConfigPrivacy.UNKNOWN, as that is not
    well-defined (and fails with current trunk).
  * debian/tests/nm: Introduce "auto_connect" option to start_nm() to disable
    automatic connections (to wired devices), and add a "manual IPv4" case to
    the Ethernet tests.
  * debian/tests/nm: Add tests for the two explicit IPv6 PE modes for (manual)
    ethernet connections.
  * debian/tests: Only stop/restart NM once, not once per test class.
  * debian/tests/nm: Exit with a meaningful message if not called as root.

  * debian/tests/nm-wifi: Run each test in a separate subprocess. With
    upstream commit a87b5a15df the library uses private D-BUS connections which
    go stale when NM restarts for the next test and cause inconsistent
    internal state which is very hard to clean up from Python.
  * debian/tests/nm-wifi: Split IPv6 tests into "PE/private address
    preferred", "PE/public address preferred", and "PE disabled", as upstream
    and Ubuntu packages have different defaults.
  * debian/control: Set Vcs-* back to packaging trunk branch.
  * debian/tests/nm-wifi: Create/shut down test devices for each single test,
    to avoid leaked scan data from previous tests. Enable the 802.11a scan
    tests, as they work now.
  * debian/tests/nm-wifi: Add Coldplug.shell pseudo-test, for a simple
    way to run a shell inside the test AP/NM environment.
  * debian/tests/nm-wifi: Add test for killswitch handling.
  * debian/tests/nm-wifi: Add tests for suspend/resume handling.
  * Add configure-logind-detection.patch: Check libsystemd-login version for
    suspend-resume instead of systemd version, so that we can build this
    against standalone logind.

network-manager (0.9.4.0-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change the ifupdown dispatcher script and set ADDRFAM to "inet" or "inet6"
    depending on whether the connection has a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.
    Using "NetworkManager" as ADDRFAM type did confuse most ifupdown hook
    scripts and e.g. broke async NFS mounts. (Closes: #475188, #656584)
  * debian/patches/05-force-online-with-unmanaged-devices.patch: If network
    interfaces are configured in /etc/network/interfaces, NM will mark those
    devices as unmanaged by default. If such a network interface has been
    brought up by ifup, set the global online state to CONNECTED.
    (Closes: #512286)
  * No longer run the ifblacklist_migrate.sh script upon installation. This
    script was used to comment out DHCP type network interface configurations
    in /etc/network/interfaces as otherwise NM would mark such devices as
    unmanaged. This script was buggy though and sometimes created a broken
    network configuration.
    Since debian-installer in wheezy (7.0) will create proper configuration
    for NM if the network-manager package is part of the installation, this is
    no longer necessary.
    If users make a minimal system installation and install the
    network-manager package afterwards, show a warning in postinst if we
    find any interface configurations in /etc/network/interfaces.
    (Closes: #688355, #690987, #606268)

  * Move the pkla file to /etc/polkit-1 as requested by the release team.
  * debian/patches/04-systemd-set-kill-mode-process.patch: By default, when
    shutting NM down, systemd will kill everything in its cgroup. But this
    can cause problems (eg, NM thinking that dhclient crashed and then taking
    down an interface that it would otherwise have left up). Fix this by
    setting KillMode=process, which tells systemd to only kill NM itself, and
    let NM kill its children. Patch cherry-picked from upstream Git.

  * debian/patches/17-dbus-remove_max_replies_per_connection_limit.patch:
    Remove 'max_replies_per_connection' limit from D-Bus configuration which
    sets it to 512. It was intended to increase the limit from its historical
    value of 32. However, since 2007 the default limit has been 8192, so this

    report capabilities which made NM chose the wrong API to talk to the
    device. Instead, match the logic that wpa_supplicant uses to determine

  * Add Build-Depends on libnl-genl-3-dev.
  * The D-Bus policy file /etc/dbus-1/system.d/NetworkManager.conf has been
    renamed to org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.conf. Update the .install file
    and use the dh_install maintscript facility to move the conffile on
    upgrades. This requires a newer debhelper, so bump the Build-Depends
    accordingly.
  * Use dh_install maintscript to handle the other conffiles as well.

      alternate UIs (n-m-gnome, -kde, or plasma-widget-networkmanagement).
    - Add a stub for hostname events to the dispatcher script.
    - Use an Upstart startup script instead of a SystemD init script.
    - debian/network-manager.install: install the apport hook.
    - debian/network-manager.links: add a link to the apport hook to reuse for
      nm-applet.
    - debian/network-manager.prerm: add a task to stop NetworkManager when
      removing the package
    - debian/network-manager.{post,pre}{inst,rm}: drop some unnecessary
      migration steps and adjust versioning for Ubuntu package upgrades.
    - Drop debian/patches/02-dbus_access_network_manager.patch; as we don't use
      the netdev group to limit access to devices in Ubuntu.
    - debian/rules: use NSS instead of GnuTLS for crypto functions.
    - debian/rules: run dh with autoreconf.
    - debian/rules: run intltool-update in install.
    - debian/rules: add variables and targets for git snapshots.

    update to also let apport catch SIGFPE crashes.

    refreshed.
  * debian/patches/lp120363_smartcard_pkcs11.patch: refreshed so it applies
    cleanly.
  * debian/patches/50_gettext_macros.patch: workaround intltoolize issue to
    have configure generate po/Makefile.in.in.
  * debian/rules: disable tests, they fail because dbus can't be started without
    DISPLAY, which is complex in buildds. We can make do without them for now.
  * debian/network-manager.install: drop installing nm-vpn-properties.1; we
    don't generate it anymore and there is no binary that matches it.
  * debian/libnm-util2.symbols: readd symbols introduced by the smartcard patch.

  * fix LP: #356517 - NetworkManager does not detect eth0 on armel; on armel
    network devices have no visible bus and hence appear similar to virtual
    devices that got blacklisted by the fix for LP: #199140; for jaunty
    we workaround the issue by explicitly disabling the virtual device
    blacklisting on __ARMEL__

      porting)

      applied upstream

      upstream.
    - delete 41e_fix_vpn_ftbfs_dont_disable_gnome_deprecated.patch: not
      applicable
    - delete 41m_unref_dbus_connection_on_shutdown.patch: not applicable and
      appears to be properly fixed now
    - delete 41r_wpa_control_custom_timeout.patch: not applicable (wpa
      communication is now done through dbus)
    - delete 41r_wpa_control_explicit_TIMEOUT_reply_fixup.patch: not applicable
      (wpa communication is now done through dbus)
    - delete 41s_wpa_ctrl_socket_non_block.patch: not applicable as there is not
      wpa socket communication in nm 0.7 anymore

      applicable (same reason as abve)

      applicable anymore
    - delete 42a_lp50214_gnome464215_fix_hidden.patch: is different (maybe

network-manager (0.6.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/network-manager.network-manager-dispatcher.init 
    - NetworkManagerDispatcher uses the D-Bus system bus. Update the LSB
      header accordingly to avoid breakages with insserv based systems.
      (Closes: #500085)
  * debian/patches/20-manual_means_always_online.patch
    - manual-means-online: If there are interfaces that are not managed by
      NetworkManager because they have custom configuration in
      /etc/network/interfaces, we assume to be online. This is obviously not
      always correct. But reporting offline state for unmanaged devices is
      causing major hassles as more and more apps rely on NM and go into
      offline mode otherwise, even if there is a connection (established via
      ifupdown). (Closes: #491826, #502371, #509006, #509829, #511712)

  Release changes from test package previously known as 0.6.5-0ubuntu16~ppa3:

  * debian/patches/series: add new patch to quilt series

network-manager (0.6.5-0ubuntu11) gutsy; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/25_lp90267-dont-tear-down-upped-interfaces.patch: remove
        redundant nm_info output previously send to syslog/daemon.log 
        (LP: #137744).
  * debian/patches/41r_wpa_control_custom_timeout.patch: add a state timeout
       to wpa control Private struct and add functions to set/unset this custom
       timeout; in turn implement this feature and make wpa_ctrl obey this
       custom timeout.
  * debian/patches/41r_wpa_control_explicit_TIMEOUT_reply_fixup.patch: wpa_ctrl
       returns bogus reply string which may lead to access of not-initialized
       memory in case an operation times out. We fix this by explicitly setting
       reply to TIMEOUT[CLI] on wpa_ctrl side before returning.
  * debian/patches/41s_wpa_ctrl_socket_non_block.patch: setup wpa_ctrl_socket as
       a real NON_BLOCK socket to prevent one potential reason for stale states
       in network-manager (deadlocks).
  * debian/patches/41t_nm_device_wireless_index_ctrl_sockets_by_run_count.patch:
       to prevent new supplicant sockets to not conflict with sockets that might
       still exist from previous run we now append a run_count index to _all_
       socket control paths. This run_count is incremented in supplicant_cleanup
       and is mod 10 to prevent any overflow when having more than 32-bit runs.
  * debian/patches/41q_retry_supplicant_cleanup_startup_if_ctrl_interface_connect_failes.patch:
       another try to terminate wpasupplicant more graceful: new shutdown
       sequence sends disable_network, ap_scan 0, interface_remove, terminate.
  * debian/patches/41u_custom_timeout_for_some_wpa_ctrl_operations.patch: we now
       use a custom timeout for ctrl operations: INTERFACE_ADD, DISABLE_NETWORK,
       TERMINATE; we take care that this timeout is unset after operations are
       through.
  * debian/patches/series: add all these great new patches to quilt _series_.
  * debian/patches/41d_ipw3945_turn_off_essid_in_stage1.patch,
      41l_enable_ipw3945_reset_essid.patch,series: drop from patchset - because
      we have a real fix in ipw3945 driver now.
  * debian/patches/41n_graceful_supplicant_shutdown.patch: update patch in turn of
      dropping the patches above.

  Revert all changes from 0.6.5-0ubuntu1 and 0.6.5-0ubuntu2 to
  redo new upstream source merge ...

  Drop network-manager-gnome as gnome because the gui code is
  now shipped in separate source:
    * debian/network-manager-gnome.install,
      debian/network-manager-gnome.manpages,
      debian/nm-applet.sgml: obsolete files dropped

    * debian/rules: don't create/install nm-applet manpage anymore

    * debian/control: drop network-manager-gnome package


  Adapt ubuntu patchset in turn of new upstream release 0.6.5:    
    * debian/patches/05-debian_backend.patch: our @add_data changes
      has been applied upstream - drop first hunk of interface_parser.c
      diff.

    * debian/patches/09_fix_bigendian_words.patch: drop as 
      AC_C_BIGENDIAN check is now applied upstream - drop patch.

    * debian/patches/10-po_fr.patch: we only had modifications for
      applet .po entries. applet moved to its own source - drop patch.

    * debian/patches/11-man_page_sh_name.patch: +.SH NAME as been
      added upstream for /man/NetworkManagerDispatcher.1.in and
      man/NetworkManager.1.in; thus, only keep diff for man/nm-tool.1.in.

    * debian/patches/12_dbus1.0.patch: dbus_connection_disconnect was
      replaced by dbus_connection_close + dbus_connection_unref; our
      patch previously replaced dbus_connection_disconnect with
      dbus_connection_unref (only) - drop patch due to upstream fix.

    * debian/patches/13-rml-wpa-workarounds.patch: simple reapply patch
      manually as upstream changed some unrelated code in patch proximity.
  
    * debian/patches/18_static_network-admin.patch: patch for gnome
      applet only; since source has moved it has to go - drop patch
  
    * debian/patches/21_manual_means_always_online.diff: drop patch
      for gnome applet code; recalc line numbers of other patches for
      updated underlying upstream version; apply hunk
      src/NetworkManagerMain.h manually because upstream changed code
      in proximity.
  
    * debian/patches/22_manual_config_available_when_connected.patch:
      applet changes only - drop patch
  
    * debian/patches/23_nm-monitor-eni.diff: manually apply
      src/NetworkManagerSystem.h patch whose underlying code base
      was changed within proximity of changes; in turn recalc patch

network-manager (0.6.4-6ubuntu7) feisty; urgency=low

  * 21_manual_means_always_online.diff:
    The previous version of this patch (ubuntu5) made a change to nm-applet
    that would assume the state was disconnected if the device list was empty.
    This didn't work since the device list is always empty on start because
    the status is obtained first.

    This was guarding against having the connected state with no devices,
    which broke later assertions.  Change the patch to correct those
    assertions instead; a connected state with no active device will now
    display the wired icon with a "Manual network configuration" tooltip.

    LP: #82335, #105234.

  * 05-debian_backend.patch:
    Revert change in ubuntu3 that commented out the blacklisting of
    devices listed in /etc/network/interfaces with more exotic configuration
    than just inet dhcp.  This was done by the above patch in ubuntu5, it
    seems silly to do it there, better to do it in the original patch.

  * 22_manual_config_available_when_connected.patch:
    Display the "Manual configuration" menu option when we have no devices,
    but are connected; since that means some number of blacklisted devices
    exist.  Don't display the "No network devices" message in that case.

network-manager (0.6.4-6ubuntu4) feisty; urgency=low

  * /etc/network/interfaces can have more than one instance of the same
    interface. For example:

    iface eth0 inet dhcp
    and later
    iface eth0 inet6 static

    The function ifparser_getif is capable only to return the first instance
    of eth0 that is a legal entry for NM to take over, but NM still does not
    know how to handle what's next.

    Patch 19_interfaces_can_have_more_than_one_instance.patch creates a sub
    list of linked if_block via nextsame, binding together all if_block's
    related to the same interface and preserving if_data for each block.

    Patch 20_do_not_take_over_dhcpv4iface_when_v6_is_configured.patch
    blacklist interfaces that have dhcp for inet configuration but have an
    inet6 entry following later on. NM does not know yet how to
    store/restore/configure IPv6 (blacklisted too) so for now we tell NM
    to keep the hands off these interfaces.

Old Changelog:
network-manager (0.6.3-2ubuntu7) feisty; urgency=low

  * Add debian/patches/00upstream-ftbfs.patch:
    - Fix dbus version check in src/NetworkManagerDbus.c to work with dbus
      1.0.
    - src/nm-netlink-monitor.c: Standard fix for new if_addr.h world order.
    - These issues are already fixed in the currently pending Debian merge, so
      this patch can go away soon.
  * Add debian/patches/13_avahi-autoipd.patch:
    - src/nm-device.c: Do not use the internal get_autoip() function, but
      instead check if avahi-autoipd was engaged for the interface and do not
      meddle with the settings in that case. This is in accordance with
      upstream who wants to completely throw away the internal IPv4LL code.
    - src/dhcp-manager/nm-dhcp-manager.c: Raise DHCP timeout from 45 seconds
      to 99 seconds, thus effectively disabling it. We want to use
      dhclient.conf's timeout configuration; if that happens to be longer, we
      interrupt dhclient while it's still working and get confused if the IP
      suddenly changes underneath us.
    - src/dhcp-manager/nm-dhcp-manager.c: Treat DHCDBD_FAIL like
      DHCDBD_TIMEOUT, i. e. continue with stage 4 of device activation
      (IPv4LL address assignment) instead of giving up and trying all over
      again. Since dhcdbd calls dhclient in single-shot mode (-1), it will
      never return with TIMEOUT, only with FAILURE, and we want to go into
      zeroconf mode instead of being stuck in an endless retry loop.

    - Add dh_iconcache to network-manager-gnome.

 -- Christian Bjälevik <nafallo@ubuntu.com> Sun, 6 Aug 2006 12:32:52 +0200

network-manager (0.6.3-2ubuntu2) edgy; urgency=low

    breaking the builds.

 -- Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com> Sun, 30 Jul 2006 23:24:43 +0100

network-manager (0.6.3-2ubuntu1) edgy; urgency=low

  * Merge with debian unstable, using Debian packaging as a base.
    Remaining changes:
    - our HAL daemon runs as the "haldaemon" user, not "hal",
    - use at_console="true" instead of netdev,
    - retain rml's workarounds patch,
    - retain j's hostap patch.

network-manager (0.6.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * More integration work. (Closes: #355244)
    - Added network-manager-dispatcher.script and
      06-dispatch_more_events.patch.
      This way the scripts in /etc/networks/if-*.d/ are called properly by
      NetworkManagerDispatcher.
      Thanks to the Ubuntu devs for this work!
    - Added 08-disabled_devices.patch. Network interfaces listed in
      /etc/network/interfaces which are not configured "auto" and "dhcp" are
      not handled by NM. This makes it possible to configure interfaces 
      statically and have NM not messing with them. 
      Updated README.Debian to reflect these changes.
    - Added 09-nm_bad_mutex_free.patch. Otherwise NM crashes if a device is
      disabled.
  * Added 07-libnm_glib_reconnect_dbus.patch which makes libnm_glib sleep 
    between unsuccessful connection attempts to dbus. (Closes: #366010)
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.7.2, no further changes required.
  * Removed *.la files from the dev packages as we also ship pkg-config files
    which are a better alternative.
  * Added 10-interface_parser_fixes.patch which fixes several problems with
    the /etc/network/interfaces parser. (Closes: #355564)

  * New upstream release.

    anymore.
  * The wpa_supplicant binary was moved from /usr/sbin to /sbin. Updated
    debian/rules accordingly.
  * Added dependency on hal (Closes: #356622)
  * Added autostart file to network-manager-gnome. This way nm-applet is
    started automatically on login.

    connections.
