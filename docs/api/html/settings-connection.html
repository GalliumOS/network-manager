<td><pre class="screen">auth-retries</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">int32</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">-1</pre></td>
<td>The number of retries for the authentication. Zero means to try indefinitely; -1 means to use a global default. If the global default is not set, the authentication retries for 3 times before failing the connection. Currently this only applies to 802-1x authentication.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre class="screen">autoconnect</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">boolean</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">TRUE</pre></td>
<td>Whether or not the connection should be automatically connected by NetworkManager when the resources for the connection are available. TRUE to automatically activate the connection, FALSE to require manual intervention to activate the connection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre class="screen">autoconnect-priority</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">int32</pre></td>

<td><pre class="screen">autoconnect-retries</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">int32</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">-1</pre></td>
<td>The number of times a connection should be tried when autoactivating before giving up. Zero means forever, -1 means the global default (4 times if not overridden). Setting this to 1 means to try activation only once before blocking autoconnect. Note that after a timeout, NetworkManager will try to autoconnect again.</td>
</tr>

<td><pre class="screen">autoconnect-slaves</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">NMSettingConnectionAutoconnectSlaves (int32)</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen"></pre></td>
<td>Whether or not slaves of this connection should be automatically brought up when NetworkManager activates this connection. This only has a real effect for master connections. The permitted values are: 0: leave slave connections untouched, 1: activate all the slave connections with this connection, -1: default. If -1 (default) is set, global connection.autoconnect-slaves is read to determine the real value. If it is default as well, this fallbacks to 0.</td>

<td><pre class="screen">interface-name</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">string</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen"></pre></td>
<td>The name of the network interface this connection is bound to. If not set, then the connection can be attached to any interface of the appropriate type (subject to restrictions imposed by other settings). For software devices this specifies the name of the created device. For connection types where interface names cannot easily be made persistent (e.g. mobile broadband or USB Ethernet), this property should not be used. Setting this property restricts the interfaces a connection can be used with, and if interface names change or are reordered the connection may be applied to the wrong interface.</td>

<tr>
<td><pre class="screen">name</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">string</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">connection</pre></td>
<td>The setting's name, which uniquely identifies the setting within the connection.  Each setting type has a name unique to that type, for example "ppp" or "wireless" or "wired".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre class="screen">permissions</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">array of string</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">[]</pre></td>
<td>An array of strings defining what access a given user has to this connection.  If this is NULL or empty, all users are allowed to access this connection; otherwise users are allowed if and only if they are in this list.  When this is not empty, the connection can be active only when one of the specified users is logged into an active session.  Each entry is of the form "[type]:[id]:[reserved]"; for example, "user:dcbw:blah". At this time only the "user" [type] is allowed.  Any other values are ignored and reserved for future use.  [id] is the username that this permission refers to, which may not contain the ":" character. Any [reserved] information present must be ignored and is reserved for future use.  All of [type], [id], and [reserved] must be valid UTF-8.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre class="screen">read-only</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">boolean</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">FALSE</pre></td>
<td>FALSE if the connection can be modified using the provided settings service's D-Bus interface with the right privileges, or TRUE if the connection is read-only and cannot be modified.</td>

<tr>
<td><pre class="screen">secondaries</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">array of string</pre></td>

<td>Setting name of the device type of this slave's master connection (eg, "bond"), or NULL if this connection is not a slave.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre class="screen">stable-id</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">string</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen"></pre></td>
<td>Token to generate stable IDs for the connection. The stable-id is used for generating IPv6 stable private addresses with ipv6.addr-gen-mode=stable-privacy. It is also used to seed the generated cloned MAC address for ethernet.cloned-mac-address=stable and wifi.cloned-mac-address=stable. Note that also the interface name of the activating connection and a per-host secret key is included into the address generation so that the same stable-id on different hosts/devices yields different addresses. If the value is unset, an ID unique for the connection is used. Specifying a stable-id allows multiple connections to generate the same addresses. Another use is to generate IDs at runtime via dynamic substitutions. The '$' character is treated special to perform dynamic substitutions at runtime. Currently supported are "${CONNECTION}", "${BOOT}", "${RANDOM}". These effectively create unique IDs per-connection, per-boot, or every time. Any unrecognized patterns following '$' are treated verbatim, however are reserved for future use. You are thus advised to avoid '$' or escape it as "$$". For example, set it to "${CONNECTION}/${BOOT}" to create a unique id for this connection that changes with every reboot. Note that two connections only use the same effective id if their stable-id is also identical before performing dynamic substitutions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre class="screen">timestamp</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">uint64</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">0</pre></td>
<td>The time, in seconds since the Unix Epoch, that the connection was last _successfully_ fully activated. NetworkManager updates the connection timestamp periodically when the connection is active to ensure that an active connection has the latest timestamp. The property is only meant for reading (changes to this property will not be preserved).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre class="screen">type</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">string</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen"></pre></td>
<td>Base type of the connection. For hardware-dependent connections, should contain the setting name of the hardware-type specific setting (ie, "802-3-ethernet" or "802-11-wireless" or "bluetooth", etc), and for non-hardware dependent connections like VPN or otherwise, should contain the setting name of that setting type (ie, "vpn" or "bridge", etc).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre class="screen">uuid</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">string</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen"></pre></td>
<td>A universally unique identifier for the connection, for example generated with libuuid.  It should be assigned when the connection is created, and never changed as long as the connection still applies to the same network.  For example, it should not be changed when the "id" property or NMSettingIP4Config changes, but might need to be re-created when the Wi-Fi SSID, mobile broadband network provider, or "type" property changes. The UUID must be in the format "2815492f-7e56-435e-b2e9-246bd7cdc664" (ie, contains only hexadecimal characters and "-").</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><pre class="screen">zone</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen">string</pre></td>
<td><pre class="screen"></pre></td>
<td>The trust level of a the connection.  Free form case-insensitive string (for example "Home", "Work", "Public").  NULL or unspecified zone means the connection will be placed in the default zone as defined by the firewall. When updating this property on a currently activated connection, the change takes effect immediately.</td>
