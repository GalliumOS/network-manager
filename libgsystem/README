libgsystem is intended to be used as a git external for components
that depend on GLib, but accept a hard dependency on things which are
difficult to do in GLib itself.  For example, the local-alloc API
depends on GCC/clang.

It will also be a useful place to evolve new APIs (e.g. logging)
before their eventual inclusion in GLib (if ever).

There's no bugzilla component currently, please mail
