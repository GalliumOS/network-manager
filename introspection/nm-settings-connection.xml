        Update:
        @properties: New connection settings, properties, and (optionally) secrets.

        Update the connection with new settings and properties (replacing all
        previous settings and properties) and save the connection to disk. Secrets
        may be part of the update request, and will be either stored in persistent
        storage or sent to a Secret Agent for storage, depending on the flags
        associated with each secret.

        UpdateUnsaved:
        @properties: New connection settings, properties, and (optionally) secrets.

        Update the connection with new settings and properties (replacing all
        previous settings and properties) but do not immediately save the
        connection to disk. Secrets may be part of the update request and may sent
        to a Secret Agent for storage, depending on the flags associated with each
        secret. Use the 'Save' method to save these changes to disk. Note that
        unsaved changes will be lost if the connection is reloaded from disk
        (either automatically on file change or due to an explicit
        ReloadConnections call).

        are often protected. Secrets must be requested separately using the

        Get the secrets belonging to this network configuration. Only secrets from
        persistent storage or a Secret Agent running in the requestor's session
        will be returned. The user will never be prompted for secrets as a result
        of this request.

        Updated:

        Emitted when any settings or permissions change. When handling this

        the connection.

        longer exists. Also see the Settings.ConnectionRemoved signal.
